# My-Recipe-App
This is my project as I learn how to code in REACT, watching an YouTube video by Dev Ed.


A simple app built using REACT & Node.js to:
- fetch recipe information through an API (https://developer.edamam.com/ >  you need to sign up to get the API Key)
- use a search form to query recipes with the search term in the title
- listing all the recipes (title, image, ingredients, calories) using a bit of CSS formatting.

Screenshot attached.
